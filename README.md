# star-upcDst

- Description
star-upcDst, is a new framework mainly developed by Jarda Adam, to simplify analysis that are related to forward and UPC physics. One can use this framework in 2 major steps, or only the 2nd step if the PicoDst files are generated by the 1st step already:

	- 1. Use MuDst files as input, 
	- 2. Use the result of step 1
